"""Definition of the main plugin.

If you have multiple plugins, it's recommended to create `plugins` module and
put every plugin into a separate submodule. Or even create a separate extension
for every plugin, if they are not really related.

It's possible to put multiple plugins into single module, but it may affect a
bit order of plugin in CKAN v2.10 because of implementation details of plugins
core. If order of plugins does not change anything, it's safe to define plugins
in the same file.

Blankets decorating the plugin are used to provide default implementation of
corresponding interfaces. When blanket is applied, it reads content from the
certain module and register it using CKAN Interface.

Source module for blanket is defined by CKAN recommendations. `cli` blanket
reads content from `cli.py`, `actions` blanket reads content from
`logic/action.py`, etc.

If you have a different project structure, you have two alternatives. Blankets
accept either a collection of items for corresponding interface, or a function
that can produce such collection.

Example:
    ```python
    def get_actions():
        return {"{{ cookiecutter.project_shortname }}_something": something}

    helpers = {"{{ cookiecutter.project_shortname }}_hello": hello}

    @tk.blanket.actions(get_actions)
    @tk.blanket.helpers(helpers)
    class {{ cookiecutter.plugin_class_name }}(...):
        ...
    ```
